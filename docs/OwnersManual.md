# {APP_NAME} — Quick Owner’s Guide (Plain English)

**For:** {CLIENT_NAME} • **Version:** {TEMPLATE_VERSION} • **Demo:** {DEMO_URL}

Welcome! This is your starter app. It already includes login, a simple dashboard, a settings page, and one sample list (“Projects”). This page tells you what you can do **today** in the simplest possible way.

---

## 1) What you got

- A clean app you can brand with your **logo** and **colors**
- **Login/Sign up** works out of the box
- A **Dashboard** and **Settings** page
- A sample **Projects** list you can rename to anything (Clients, Orders, etc.)

> Want payments, calendars, or roles? Those are optional add‑ons—just ask.

---

## 2) See it running

You have two options:

**Option A — We set it up for you (fastest)**
Choose the **Deploy & Setup** add‑on. We’ll jump on a call via screensharing, connect the keys, and publish your app.

**Option B — You (or your teammate) runs it**

1. Open the file named `.env.local.example` and copy it to `.env.local`.
2. In your Supabase account, copy the **Project URL** and **Anon Key**. Paste them into `.env.local`.
3. Run the app: `npm install` → `npm run dev` → open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

> Think of the keys like passwords—never share them publicly or put them in emails.

---

## 3) Make it yours (2–5 minutes)

- **Logo:** replace the file in `/public/logo` with your logo (PNG/SVG)
- **App name:** we can change the name shown in the top bar
- **Colors:** set your brand color (we’ll point you to the place if you want to DIY)
- **Menu links:** rename items in the left sidebar to match your terms

If you prefer, we can do these for you during a short handoff call.
